Welcome! This is a Pomodoro Timer made in JAVA. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method created by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro", from the Italian word for "tomato", after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

The Pomodoro technique has been widely adopted by students and professionals alike. The timer is started and the user works on the task at hand for 25 minutes. Once the 25 minutes is up, the user takes a 5 minute break. After 4 "pomodoros", the user takes a longer break, typically 15-20 minutes.

This Pomodoro Timer is a simple JAVA application with a graphical user interface. The user can start the timer, pause the timer, and reset the timer. The timer will continue to run even if the user minimizes the application.

Thank you for trying out this Pomodoro Timer!
